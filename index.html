                        <p class="paragraph" >I am currently at school as a student in Moringa, after enrolling in Strathmore for certificate in IT i loved seeing people coding but yet i wasn't sure about it, untill i went to Tunapanda Institute, where i found people like "Sadatt" who encouraged me to code as he took me through the basic steps in learning to code a bit.I got supper motivated in programming hence i joined moringa as i was told it wasone of the best school for coding.So far so good i am working with a good team and the best Team Leader whom we mostly refer to them as "TM" i know my journey in coding will be a success.</p>
